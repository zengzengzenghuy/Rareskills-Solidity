1. How does ERC721A save gas?
   ERC721A save gas by batching all ERC721 minting transactions into one transaction, thus minting multiple ERC721 tokens costs the same as minting one ERC721 token.

2. Where does it add cost?
   The cost is added in the ownerOf function, where it has to check maxBatchSize and loop through the tokenId mapping decrementally to find the ownerOf and address.
